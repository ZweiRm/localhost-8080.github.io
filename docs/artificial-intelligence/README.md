# Artifitical Intelligence

## Definition
The definition of AI can be classified into four dimensions.  
|Tinking humanly|Thinking rationally|

+ **Acting humanly** Turing Test  
  [Turing Test](/hello-world/computing-machinery-and-intelligence) testing whether machines have intelligent behavior like human. A computer wanted to pass the test should having the capabilities like: **Natural language processing**, **Knowledge representation**, **Automated reasoning** and **Machine learning**.  
  
  + Category  
    + (Normal) Turing Test: Avoding direct physical interaction between interrogator and computer.  
    + Total Turing Test: Providing computer vision and robotics.

  + Category about AI  
    + Strong AI: Can be conscious.  
    + Weak AI: Conscious is not compulsory.  

+ **Thinking humanly** The Cognitive Modelling Approach（认知建模法）  
  To find out how human think, we have the methods like: **Introspection**（内省）and **Psychological experiments**. Analyse and use it to determine whether a program of mechanism can thinking like human. Setting up a new filed called Congnitive Science which is a combination of psychology and AI.  

  + General Problem Solver (GPS)  
    Focusing on reasoning. Cheking whether the reasoning steps are match with human's.  

+ **Thinking Rationally** The Law of Thought Approach（法则思维法）  
  Right thinking.
  
  + Obstacles  
    1. No 100% certain knowledge.  
    2. Solving problems "in principle" and "in practice" is difficult. (E.g. Having a theory but it can not be done in a reasonable time.)  

+ **Acting Rationally** The Rational Agent Approach（理性代理法）  
  Consider AI as the study and construction of rational agents.  
  *Agents is something can perceive and act.  

  + Advantages (compare with The Laws of Thought Approach)  
    1. More general  
    2. More amenable to scientific development
