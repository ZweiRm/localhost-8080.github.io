I&#39;m Duo Huang, currently working as a Software R&amp;D Engineer specializing in Android framework development and machine learning integration at Xiaomi Inc. My professional work centers on advancing the Android ecosystem, particularly focusing on (Display &amp; Window Management, Process &amp; Activity Management, Rendering &amp; Drawing with the aim of enhancing user experience through innovative system architecture and optimized algorithmic solutions.</p><p>I earned my Master of Science in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence degree from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I received a Merit Scholarship for my academic performance. My research interests primarily include Systems with AI, Mobile Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Cloud Computing, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning.</p><p>My academic and practical experiences include numerous patents in advanced application casting technologies and dynamic link switching methods. Additionally, I have led Xiaomi&#39;s xTS compliance initiatives, significantly contributing to Google&#39;s Android ecosystem standards and resolving critical ecosystem issues.</p><p>I remain committed to driving technological advancement through rigorous research, active collaboration, and continuous contributions to the open-source community. One of the most fulfilling experiences is knowing that my code positively impacts nearly every Android device around the globe. I&#39;ve significantly contributed to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), specifically in areas of display spatial logic, cutout management, and system robustness improvements, positively influencing billions of devices globally. Moving forward, I aim to continue bridging academia and industry, advancing technological innovations, and contributing meaningfully to global scientific and technological progress.</p><h2 id="publication-patent" tabindex="-1">Publication &amp; Patent <a class="header-anchor" href="#publication-patent" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publication &amp; Patent&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Patent: Duo Huang, Heli Li, “A Screen Casting Method, Screen Casting Device, Electronic Device, Storage Medium and Programme Product (A Machine Learning and Configuration- based Viewing Issues Auto-Detecting-Fixing and Relaunching Method for Application Screencasting)”, application No.: 2025102210572</li><li>Patent: Duo Huang, “A Method of Security and Privacy Detection and Application Navigation Blocking for Large-Screen Application Casting with Machine Learning Approachd”</li><li>Patent: Duo Huang, Yan Zhang, “A Large-screen-casting Application Transferring and Adapting Method”</li><li>Patent: Deqing Zhu, Duo Huang, “A Dynamic Link Switching Method for Multi-Device Handoff Service of Large Screen Application Casting”</li><li>Patent: Ruyue Geng, Duo Huang, etl., “Window Warping Method, Device, Storage Medium, and Chip (A Window-Based Distortion Animation Method)”, application No.: 202211691403.6, open to public</li><li>Software Publication: Duo Huang, etl., “Design and Implementation of Health Management Platform for Special Groups”, 2018SR796507, Software Registration No. 3125602</li><li>Software Publication: Duo Huang, “Design and Implementation of Online Examination Platform on Java”, 2018SR611370, Software Registration No. 2940465</li></ul><h2 id="open-source-project-contributions" tabindex="-1">Open Source Project Contributions <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-project-contributions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Open Source Project Contributions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="android-open-source-project-aosp-google" tabindex="-1">Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Google <a class="header-anchor" href="#android-open-source-project-aosp-google" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Google&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Redesigned display spatial logic to dynamically integrate widget/camera cutouts, eliminating layout misalignments in multi-cutout environments<br> Gerrit CLs: <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3026725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3026725</a></li><li>Designed robust validation logic with dynamic tolerance, eliminating precision loss in mirrored activity calculations and enhancing system stability in Media Projection-related testing<br> Gerrit CLs: <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3309476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3309476</a></li><li>Streamlined cutout calculations in WindowManagerAnimation by removing coupling and establishing unidirectional data flow for consistent cross-cutout configurations<br> Gerrit CLs: <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3505814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/3505814</a></li><li>Designed robustness logic with dynamic cutout calculation for system bar (collaboration)<br> Gerrit CLs: <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/3554263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/3554263</a></li></ul><h2 id="web-projects" tabindex="-1">Web Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#web-projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Web Projects&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="a-web-based-java-online-judge-system" tabindex="-1">A Web Based Java Online Judge System <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-web-based-java-online-judge-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Web Based Java Online Judge System&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://gitee.com/lagee_online_quizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gitee Repository</a></p><h3 id="ahza-health-care-platform-for-individuals" tabindex="-1">Ahza Health Care Platform for Individuals <a class="header-anchor" href="#ahza-health-care-platform-for-individuals" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ahza Health Care Platform for Individuals&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/ZweiRm/ahza_health_mixfront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github Repository</a></p><h3 id="ahza-coupon" tabindex="-1">Ahza Coupon <a class="header-anchor" href="#ahza-coupon" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ahza Coupon&quot;">​</a></h3><p><s><a href="https://coupon.ahza.xin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Website</a></s> (Currently could not access)</p>',16))]))}});export{h as __pageData,f as default};
