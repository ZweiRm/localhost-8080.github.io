Hi! I'm Duo Huang, currently working as a Software R&D Engineer specializing in Android framework development and machine learning integration at Xiaomi Inc. My professional work centers on advancing the Android ecosystem, particularly focusing on (Display & Window Management, Process & Activity Management, Rendering & Drawing with the aim of enhancing user experience through innovative system architecture and optimized algorithmic solutions.  

I earned my Master of Science in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence degree from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I received a Merit Scholarship for my academic performance. My research interests primarily include Systems with AI, Mobile Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Cloud Computing, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning.  

My academic and practical experiences include numerous patents in advanced application casting technologies and dynamic link switching methods. Additionally, I have led Xiaomi's xTS compliance initiatives, significantly contributing to Google's Android ecosystem standards and resolving critical ecosystem issues.  

I remain committed to driving technological advancement through rigorous research, active collaboration, and continuous contributions to the open-source community. One of the most fulfilling experiences is knowing that my code positively impacts nearly every Android device around the globe. I've significantly contributed to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), specifically in areas of display spatial logic, cutout management, and system robustness improvements, positively influencing billions of devices globally. Moving forward, I aim to continue bridging academia and industry, advancing technological innovations, and contributing meaningfully to global scientific and technological progress.
